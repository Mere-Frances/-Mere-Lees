        "mainText": "Branding is more than just a logo or a catchy tagline—it’s about identity, purpose, and connection. Some brands just get it, effortlessly weaving their values into everything they do. Here are a few that stand out, not just for their aesthetics but for the stories they tell.<br><br>1. Ben & Jerry’s has been actively posting on social media about standing up for human rights and relevant social issues. And believe it or not, it's working. People who align with these values are showing their support not just through likes and comments but with their wallets. People don't want to support profit hungry companies, they don't want empty statements or performative activism, and Ben & Jerry’s purpose is not just their tagline, it's something they live show and make decisions with. That and their dairy free chocolate chip cookie dough is phenomenal.<br/><br/>2. Marla Aaron is just one of those brands that is just branding perfection to me. What I'm really foaming at the mouth for is their logo, they have been at the top of my list of favourite logos for a very long time. Their logo is designed by Savvy Studio. I just love the unique placement of the type, the overlapping A’s, and what's even better is their smaller version, which incorporates the product itself. I can't say that it's 100% my style, but their design identity definitely captures the essence of the brand and of the product.<br/><br/>3. Costa Brazil is one of those brands that beautifully captures that you don't have to have the most exciting logo, fonts and colors in order to have good branding. One thing I love about a minimal approach, is it allows people to have creativity beyond just the logos, fonts and colors. The founder of this brand Francisco Costa used to be the creative director of Calvin Klein, and is also Brazilian so that makes up the origin story of this brand, and the entirety of Costa Brazil is very closely tied to its founder (Francisco), and that is where the brand's heart and soul comes from.",

        "mainText": "As a woman navigating the ever-evolving world of web development, I've been reflecting on the importance of uplifting each other and building a strong, supportive community of women in tech.<br><br>When I first started my journey in web development, I often found myself feeling isolated and intimidated by the industry itself. It wasn’t always easy to find other women who shared the same passion for coding, design, and all things tech. But over the years, I’ve discovered small communities and just how powerful it can be when we come together to support and uplift one another.<br><br>One of the things I’m most passionate about is creating and being apart of spaces where women can connect, learn, and grow together. Whether it’s through online communities, local meetups, or larger tech conferences, these spaces are invaluable for sharing knowledge, resources, and encouragement. I’ve seen firsthand how a strong network can make all the difference—not just in our careers, but in our confidence and sense of belonging. There are so many amazing events and initiatives focused on empowering women, and I’m eager to participate in as many as I can. Because these events are not just opportunities to learn new skills or hear from industry leaders—they’re a chance to meet other women who are on similar journeys, to share our stories, and to inspire one another.<br><br>One of my goals in attending these events is to not only gain knowledge but also to use my platform to help other women. By sharing what I learn, by being open about my experiences—the highs and the lows—I hope to encourage other women to pursue their dreams in tech with confidence and resilience. As I learn from others, I’m constantly reminded of the importance of staying curious, of pushing the boundaries of what I know, and of never settling for less than what I’m capable of achieving. Let’s continue to uplift one another, to share our knowledge and our stories, and to build the kind of tech industry that we can all be proud of.<br><br>With love and code.",

        "mainText": "Neo-Brutalism in web design and art has captivated the industry with its raw, unpolished aesthetic that emphasizes functionality and authenticity. Drawing inspiration from the mid-20th-century architectural movement, Neo-Brutalism rejects the overly polished and minimalist designs prevalent today, favouring a more honest and straightforward approach.<br><br>Neo-Brutalism stands out as a bold and rebellious choice in a world where many websites look and feel the same, defying conventional design norms and making a statement. Emphasizing functionality over aesthetics, this utilitarian approach ensures that design serves its purpose effectively without unnecessary embellishments. By introducing a unique visual language, Neo-Brutalism encourages designers to think outside the box and fosters creativity and innovation.<br><br>Rejecting modern web design conventions pushes boundaries, leading to more engaging and effective user experiences. The minimalist and utilitarian nature of Neo-Brutalism contributes to more sustainable web design practices, creating lighter, faster, and more efficient websites. Its rise can be attributed to cultural shifts towards authenticity and transparency, as people seek more genuine experiences in both the physical and digital worlds.<br><br>Social media platforms like Instagram and Pinterest have played a significant role in popularizing Neo-Brutalism, with designers and artists sharing their bold, brutalist creations, inspiring others to adopt the trend. Major tech industry players, such as Stripe and Dropbox, have also embraced Neo-Brutalism, further propelling its popularity and lending credibility and visibility to this distinctive design approach.",
