The goal was to create a modern, visually appealing site that aligns with FOGB’s brand identity and fosters community engagement. This redesign effort was rooted in research into the current site’s usability and user experience, identifying pain points and opportunities for enhancement. The result was a website that clearly conveys FOGB’s mission, highlights its impact on Golden Bay, and encourages user involvement through accessible and engaging design choices.",
        "biographyTools": "The development of the Friends of Golden Bay website involved a wide range of tools and techniques essential to web design and development. SCSS/SASS was used for CSS processing, which facilitated efficient styling and allowed for more maintainable code. Advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript contributed to creating responsive and interactive interfaces, ensuring an engaging experience across devices. User testing and UX research techniques shaped the project’s initial design concepts, focusing on a user-centered approach. Key considerations were also given to cultural respect and the Treaty of Waitangi, ensuring the project aligned with New Zealand's values. Collaborative tools were used to test and refine design prototypes, and CSS methodologies were applied consistently to meet usability standards.",
        "biographyOutcome": "The completed Friends of Golden Bay website achieved its core objectives: reflecting FOGB’s mission through a cohesive, minimal, and modern design. It provides users with easy access to information on FOGB's campaigns, donation opportunities, and contact options, encouraging engagement through clear call-to-action elements. The site’s responsive design makes it accessible across devices, promoting ease of use and readability. The final design effectively addressed the issues of inconsistent content and poor user engagement present in the previous version, resulting in a functional, user-friendly website that conveys FOGB’s mission in an impactful way.",
        "biographyReflection": "Working on the Friends of Golden Bay project was a rewarding experience, offering insights into both technical skills and project management. An interview with FOGB representative Andrew provided valuable context on the organization and made the process feel more personal and engaging. I found particular enjoyment and efficiency in coding and building the site, especially when experimenting with SCSS and JavaScript on a larger scale. While these elements presented challenges, they motivated me to further my knowledge and enhance my designs. Time management emerged as a key lesson, highlighting the importance of balancing tasks in large-scale projects. In future projects, I plan to approach time constraints proactively, breaking content into manageable segments to maintain focus on the project’s holistic quality. Ultimately, I’m proud of the site we delivered and am excited to continue improving it as I gain more experience.",

        "biographyBrief": "This project was my first full-stack application, built using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—alongside SCSS for styling. I designed this platform as an interactive space where users can register, log in, and manage their own posts while engaging with content from other users. The core functionality of the site revolves around CRUD operations, enabling users to create, edit, and delete posts and comments. I implemented password hashing and salting for secure user authentication, while a custom database API keeps the app running efficiently and securely. SCSS/SASS brings a clean and modern design to the interface, making the site easy to navigate and visually engaging.",
        "biographyTools": "To bring this project to life, I used a variety of essential tools and technologies that made the development process both challenging and rewarding. MongoDB served as the database, storing user and post data, while Express.js and Node.js handled server-side logic. React was used on the front end to create a dynamic and responsive interface, while SCSS provided the styling needed for a modern and polished look. For testing and validating the API, I used Postman, which helped ensure each endpoint functioned as intended. Working with the MERN stack and SCSS demonstrated the power and flexibility of these technologies in building an interactive, full-stack application.",
        "biographyOutcome": "The final outcome is a user-friendly, interactive platform that allows for seamless user management and content interaction. The CRUD functionality and secure authentication work together smoothly, providing users with a cohesive experience in creating and engaging with content. The SCSS styling gave the project a clean and contemporary look, aligning well with the goals of accessibility and ease of use. It was exciting to see all the features—user registration, login, posting, and commenting—come together into a functional application that aligns well with the initial design vision.",
        "biographyReflection": "Working on this full-stack project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into the MERN stack and experience how each technology contributes to a fully functional application. Building a secure user management system with hashed and salted passwords was especially rewarding, as it challenged me to focus on application security alongside functionality. Seeing everything come together—from the API to the front-end design—reinforced the value of full-stack development in creating interactive and user-centered applications. Overall, this project pushed me to explore new technologies and tools, and it has motivated me to keep building and refining my skills in full-stack development.",

        "biographyBrief": "This personal side project involved designing and developing a prototype for an online print store for a family member. The goal was to create a single-page website that was visually appealing, easy to navigate, and functional. The design aimed to reflect the business’s brand while providing an engaging user experience for potential customers looking to purchase print products. It was intended to be a proof of concept, showcasing how the online store could look and operate in a real-world scenario.",
        "biographyTools": "For this project, I used a combination of front-end technologies to bring the design to life. I structured the website with HTML, styled it with SCSS, and added interactivity using JavaScript and jQuery. To enhance the visual and functional elements, I incorporated libraries like Swiper JS for image sliders and Mapbox for an interactive map. The design was crafted using Figma to ensure a modern and responsive layout that would work seamlessly across devices.",
        "biographyOutcome": "The outcome was a functional and visually appealing prototype that met the project's objectives. The website design was responsive, allowing users to have an optimal viewing experience across different devices. The interactive features, like the image slider and map, added a layer of dynamism that improved user engagement. The project served as a valuable prototype that could be refined further for a live production version of the online print store.",
        "biographyReflection": "This project allowed me to experiment with several front-end technologies and refine my skills in web design. Working with jQuery, SCSS, and JavaScript libraries to enhance the user experience was an excellent learning opportunity. I enjoyed the challenge of balancing aesthetics with functionality while ensuring the site remained user-friendly. It also provided a chance to practice responsive design, which I found essential for creating a seamless experience across various screen sizes. This project ignited my passion for web development and provided me with a tangible result to showcase in my portfolio.",
