        "biographyBrief": "This personal side project involved designing and developing a prototype for an online print store for a family member. The goal was to create a single-page website that was visually appealing, easy to navigate, and functional. The design aimed to reflect the business’s brand while providing an engaging user experience for potential customers looking to purchase print products. It was intended to be a proof of concept, showcasing how the online store could look and operate in a real-world scenario.",
        "biographyTools": "For this project, I used a combination of front-end technologies to bring the design to life. I structured the website with HTML, styled it with SCSS, and added interactivity using JavaScript and jQuery. To enhance the visual and functional elements, I incorporated libraries like Swiper JS for image sliders and Mapbox for an interactive map. The design was crafted using Figma to ensure a modern and responsive layout that would work seamlessly across devices.",
        "biographyOutcome": "The outcome was a functional and visually appealing prototype that met the project's objectives. The website design was responsive, allowing users to have an optimal viewing experience across different devices. The interactive features, like the image slider and map, added a layer of dynamism that improved user engagement. The project served as a valuable prototype that could be refined further for a live production version of the online print store.",
        "biographyReflection": "This project allowed me to experiment with several front-end technologies and refine my skills in web design. Working with jQuery, SCSS, and JavaScript libraries to enhance the user experience was an excellent learning opportunity. I enjoyed the challenge of balancing aesthetics with functionality while ensuring the site remained user-friendly. It also provided a chance to practice responsive design, which I found essential for creating a seamless experience across various screen sizes. This project ignited my passion for web development and provided me with a tangible result to showcase in my portfolio.",
